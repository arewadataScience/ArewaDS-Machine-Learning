#  Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Curriculum!

The Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Fellowship is a comprehensive, free program aimed at equipping aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the field. 

Our curriculum is carefully designed to guide participants through the basics of programming and data analysis to the more complex concepts of machine learning algorithms and applications. With a blend of theory and practical assignments, fellows engage in a hands-on learning experience that prepares them for real-world data science challenges.

### Key Features:
- Structured curriculum covering Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning.
- Hands-on projects and challenges to apply learning in practical scenarios.
- Access to a community of mentors and peers for collaborative learning.
- Opportunities for real-world application through capstone projects.

## Welcome to Cohort 3.0 ArewaDS Fellowship

Welcome to the Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Cohort 3.0 Fellowship!. We've organized the fellowship into three main parts:

- **[Stage 1: Python Programming for Data Science](#stage-1-getting-started)** - You'll learn the basics of pythons, set up your tools, and prepare for what's ahead. This stage is covered [here]()
- **[Stage 2: Data Science](#stage-2-data-science)** - This part covers data handling, from cleaning to analyzing.
- **[Stage 3: Machine Learning](#stage-3-machine-learning)** - Here, you'll dive into machine learning techniques and tools like Scikit-learn.

## Graduation Requirements

To graduate from the Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Fellowship, fellows must meet the following criteria:

- **Completion of Curriculum**: Fellows must complete all modules within the curriculum, including the Python challenge, Data Science, Machine Learning sections, "Learning How to Learn," and "Writing in Science" courses.

- **Assignments and Medium BlogPost**: Submission of all required assignments and assigned blog post by the specified deadlines. Posts must meet the quality standards set by the mentors.

<!-- - **Attendance**: Maintain a 90% attendance rate for weekly office hours (Saturday and Sunday). See [attendance list](https://github.com/arewadataScience/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Stage-1-Getting-Started/attendance.md) -->

- **Capstone Project**: Complete a capstone project that demonstrates the ability to apply learned skills to a real-world problem. The project must be approved by the ArewaDS Team.

## Stage 1: Getting Started

| **Duration: 6 weeks**  | [attendance list](https://github.com/arewadataScience/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Stage-1-Getting-Started/attendance.md) |


The first part of our fellowship focuses on building a strong foundation in the essential tools used in Data Science and Machine Learning.
We'll guide you through:

- **Learning Strategies**: Discover effective methods to enhance your learning and retention.
- **Development Environment**: Set up your development environment with tools like VSCode.
- **Version Control**: Learn to track and manage your code changes using Git and GitHub.
- **Python Programming**: Master the basics of Python, the language of choice for data analysis.


### Learning How to Learn

Before we delve into the technicalities, we'll explore techniques and strategies to enhance your learning process, helping you absorb and retain information more effectively.

Fellows are expected to complete the course "Learning How to Learn" from Coursera. Coursera offers financial aid. Below are the resources to get you started:

| Resource Description                    | Link                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Learning How to Learn Course            | [Go to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) |
| How to Apply for Coursera Financial Aid | [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13rUEAq5Hgo)       |

> Kindly note that if you would like to get started immediately after applying for the financial aid, you would need to click on `Audit Course` at the final page of the application, otherwise, you would need to wait the two weeks for the financial aid application to be approved. In addition, while auditing the course, one can only watch the videos and learn without the ability to submit the graded quizzes or earn the certificate.

### Setup and Installation

In this section, we'll cover how to set up your development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), including how to use Jupyter notebooks within it. We'll also dive into using a python virtual environment, Git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, and Markdown for documentation.

We have provided detailed instructions, but you might not understand all the details of the setup for now. It will become clearer as you proceed with the course. So don't despair, put on your patience hat, and ask for help when needed. There's light at the other end of the tunnel.

### 30 Days of Python Challenge

Over the course of 30 days, you'll learn Python basics, advanced features, and everything in between. Fellows are expected to practice and submit assignments for each day via Github repository.

Here's the challenge you'll be undertaking:

| Day  | Content                     | Link                                                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-30 | 30 Days of Python Challenge | [Start the Course](https://github.com/arewadataScience/30-Days-of-Python) | -->

## Stage 2: Data Science

**Duration: 6 weeks**  

- The second part of the fellowship is all about Data Science. 
  
- You'll learn to clean, visualize, and analyze data, which are key steps in any data science project. 

- Recommended Reading: [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) and [Python Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
