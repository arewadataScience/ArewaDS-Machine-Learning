# Using the Operating System's Graphical User Interface to access your local repos

## On WSL with Ubuntu
Enter the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023` directory using the `cd` command, then run `explorer.exe .` **(don't forget to include the dot! the dot means "current directory")** to open the Windows explorer in the current directory:

```bash
cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023
explorer.exe .
```

Windows Explorer should pop up now:

![Sample learning unit](assets/week_0.png "Sample learning unit")

## On Mac:
In Finder <img src='assets/finder.png' alt='Finder' width="4%" height="4%"/>, open the `Go` menu, choose the option `Go to folder...`

<img src='assets/go_to_folder.png' alt='Sample learning unit' width="70%"/>

Now paste the path to the `ds-prep-course-2023` repository: `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023`, then click `Go`.
