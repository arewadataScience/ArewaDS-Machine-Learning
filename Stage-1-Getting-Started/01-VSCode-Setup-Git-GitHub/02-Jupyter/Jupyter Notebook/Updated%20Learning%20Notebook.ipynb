Try it out! Notice that jumping to the top or bottom of the notebook does not affect the currently selected cell - it remains selected. If you'd like to go back to it, press the `up` or `down` arrow. This will select the cell above or below the current cell and move the focus back to where you came from.\n",

You can do that as well (and remember that this is just a personal tip) by clicking `Help` in the Menu bar and selecting `Edit Keyboard Shortcuts`. Search for the `restart kernel and run all cells` command and type `Ctrl-R` in the `add shortcut` field. Then click `OK` in the bottom right corner of the window. This way you can just press `Ctrl`+`R` instead of doing it manually.\n",
